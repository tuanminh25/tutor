# Q5.1.1.

## `.at` and `operator[]`

The `.at` method should piggyback off `operator[]`.  
In this case, the two bodies of the functions were identical - save for the bounds check.

```cpp
auto xector::at(size_t const i) const -> std::optional<std::string> {
    if (i >= this->size()) {
        return std::nullopt;
    }

    return this->operator[i];
}

auto xector::operator[](size_t const i) const -> std::string {
    auto curr = items_.begin();
    auto seen = size_t{0};
    for (; curr != items_.end(); ++curr) {
        if (string_contains_special(*curr)) {
            if (seen == i) {
                break;
            }
            ++seen;
        }
    }
    return *curr;
}
```

This is a common trend for STL containers like `std::vector` and `std::string`.  
The `operator[]` is usually only kept for backwards compatability with C, with `.at` as the preferred method between the two.

## Copy Methods

The copy-assignment operator mimics the initialisation steps of the copy constructor so we should piggyback of it.

```cpp
xector::xector(xector const& other) : items_{other.items_.begin(), other.items_.end()} {}

auto xector::operator=(xector const &other) -> xector& {
    if (this != &other) {
        *this = xector(other);
    }
    return *this;
}
```

## Delegating Constructors

Constructor delegation is a part of piggybacking.  
Here, the copy constructor could have delegated to the constructor taking in a `std::vector` reference.

```cpp
xector::xector(std::vector<std::string> const& items) : items_{items.begin(), items.end()} {}

xector::xector(xector const& other) : xector(other.items_) {}
```

# Q5.1.2.

This is a common example of where the `operator==` should be used.  
It would greatly simplify the logic and readability of the test.

```cpp
TEST_CASE("check xectors are equal") {
    auto north = xector{
        "ned",
        "piggy snack!",
        "stark",
        "peppa the piggy"
    };
    auto crown = xector{
        "robert",
        "piggy snack!",
        "baratheon",
        "peppa the piggy"
    };

    // now check for equality
    CHECK(north == crown);
}
```

It is okay to individually run `.at` on individual indices like in the test.

```cpp
TEST_CASE("individual .at")
```

However, if you are going to test if every single index matches against a list of expected values, it is best to use the equality operator.  
This is also the case for when other STL containers are used like `std::vector`, are used for a similar purpose.

# Q5.1.3.

These are example implementations using `<iterator>` and `<algorithm>` that we can use with the `iterator` interface.

```cpp
auto xector::operator[](size_t const i) const -> std::string {
    auto it = this->begin();
    std::advance(it, i);
    return *it;
}

auto operator==(xector const &a, xector const &b) -> bool {
    return a.size() == b.size() and std::equal(a.begin(), a.end(), b.begin());
}
```

Note that we don't have to change the implementation of `.at`, since we previously piggybacked it off `operator[]`.

This question is meant to show how iterators can simplify many methods of a class so that we:

- can write less code;
- only have to write the logic in one spot \(i.e. the iterator class\).

You should take this into consideration for your implementation of assignment 2.

# Q5.1.4.

## Criteria

### Correctness

The test is subject to a false positive - i.e. an `xector` with a wrong implementation could pass the test.  
For example, the `xector` iterator range could cover:

```txt
piggyback <- xec.begin()
sam piggy
          <- xec.end()
```

and the test would still pass, even though the last item `george piggy` was not correctly visited by the iterator.

We would need to manually check that the iterator does end after iterating on the missing item.

### Clarity

It is hard to understand that the test is trying to check against each value in the `expected` vector.  
The expected value for the current iterator value must be first calculated as an index.

```cpp
        auto index = static_cast<size_t>(i - xec.begin);
```

An alternative might have been to create a `std::vector::iterator` and have that iterate in step with the loop.

```cpp
    auto exp = expected.begin();

    for (auto i = xec.begin(); i != xec.end(); ++i) {
        auto index = static_cast<size_t>(i - xec.begin);
        CHECK(*i == *exp);
        ++exp;
    }
```

However, this still does not:

- improve the clarity of the test;
- address its correctness.

It would be better to check the expected value as it occurs in iteration, rather than storing them all in a vector.  
However, we can't do this with a loop.

### Simplicity

As per testing best practices, we should avoid loops in our testing.  
Here, the loop makes it hard to communicate which value are expecting during a test iteration.  
We could potentially use an STL algorithm like `std::equal`, however:

- if the test is wrong, we wouldn't be able to debug where the wrong output is;
- we should try stick to checks that are compile-time vertiable.

## Alternative Test

It is best to avoid loops entirely during iterator testing.  
Manually iterate through the iterator so that you can check for an expected value at a particlar point in iteration.

```cpp
TEST_CASE("testing xector iterator") {
    auto xec = xector{std::vector<std::string>{"apple", "piggyback!", "pear", "sam piggy", "george piggy"}};

    auto iter = xec.begin();
    CHECK(*iter == "piggyback!");
    ++iter;

    CHECK(*iter == "sam piggy");
    ++iter;

    CHECK(*iter == "george piggy");
    ++iter;

    CHECK(iter == xec.end());
}
```

    // this line default-constructs a new std::list
    // it doesn't produce any output

    object x;

    // same as above

    object x;
    // same as above

    l.push_back(x);
    // this will copy construct a new object based off x
    // this value lives in l
    // it produces output "copy-ctor\n"

    // end of scope
    // objects are destructed in reverse order of creation

    // x is first destructed
    // this produces output "dtor\n"

    // the destruction of l commences
    // this involves destructing all of its elements
    // this doesn't produce any output

    // the object copy-constructed from x is destructed
    // this produces output "dtor\n"

    // with l empty, l can be destructed

# 1.

```cpp
std::vector<int> a(1, 2);
```

Answer: `b`.

This is [direct initialisation](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/direct_initialization) as we are calling the following `std::vector` constructor [cpp reference](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/vector/vector).

```cpp
explicit vector( size_type count, const T& value = T(),
                 const Allocator& alloc = Allocator() );
```

We use parantheses `()` in the call, and there is a matching constructor for the argument types.

# 2.

```cpp
std::vector<int> a{1, 2};
```

Answer: `d`.

Writing a variable name and braces `{}` with a list of comma-separated values with the same type \(in this case matching the template type of the vector - `int`\), constructs an object using an [initialiser list](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/initialization).

```cpp
{ initialiser-list } // (4) on CPP Reference example
```

# 3.

```cpp
std::vector<int> b = {1, 2};
```

Answer: `c`.

Writing an equals sign `=` beforehand also initialises by initialiser list and we can refer to the explanation from part 2.

```cpp
= { initialiser-list } // (2) on CPP Reference example
```

# 4.

```cpp
std::vector<int> a{1, 2};
std::vector<int> c = a;
```

Answer: `a`.

[Copy initialisation](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/copy_initialization) is when we create an object in an expression, made from another of the same type.  
Here, we are creating from scratch \(i.e. constructing\) `c`, from `a`.

```cpp
T object = other;
```

This will usually call the copy constructor for the type.

# 5.

```cpp
std::vector<int> a{1, 2};
std::vector<int> c;
c = a;
```

Answer: `c`.

This example is only different from part 4. since `c` has already been made.  
Hence, we are now using the copy-assignment operator for `std::vector`.

As a side note, copy-assignment operators sometimes piggyback off their accompanying copy constructors, using the [copy-swap](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/copy-swap-idiom-c/) idiom, in accordance with the RAII principle and the management of heap resources.
